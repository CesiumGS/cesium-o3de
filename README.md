### :house_with_garden: Cesium for O3DE and the 3D Geospatial Ecosystem

Cesium for O3DE streams real-world 3D content such as high-resolution photogrammetry, terrain, imagery, and 3D buildings from [Cesium ion](https://cesium.com/cesium-ion) and other sources, available as optional commercial subscriptions. The plugin includes Cesium ion integration for instant access to global high-resolution 3D content ready for runtime streaming. Cesium ion users can also leverage cloud-based 3D tiling pipelines to create end-to-end workflows to transform massive heterogenous content into semantically-rich 3D Tiles, ready for streaming to the Open 3D Engine.

Cesium for O3DE supports cloud and private network content and services based on open standards and APIs. You are free to use any combination of supported content sources, standards, APIs with Cesium for O3DE.

Using Cesium ion helps support Cesium for O3DE development. :heart:

### :chains: O3DE Integration

Cesium for O3DE is tightly integrated with the Open 3D Engine making it possible to visualize and interact with real-world content in editor and at runtime.
